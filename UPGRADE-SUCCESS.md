## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working

- ✅ Drag and drop functionality (native implementation)
- ✅ Multiple item selection
- ✅ Cross-column dragging
- ✅ React 19 compatibility
- ✅ StrictMode enabled
- ✅ Vite dev server running at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ All linter checks passing
- ✅ No dependency conflicts

### 📊 Bundle Size Comparison

| Version | Dependencies                 | Bundle Impact      |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.1   | react-beautiful-dnd (~100KB) | Heavy              |
| 2.0.0   | None (native APIs)           | **Lightweight** 🎯 |

## How to Test

The dev server is already running! Open your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Test These Features:

1. **Basic Dragging**

   - Click and drag any item
   - Drop it in a different position
   - Drop it in a different column

2. **Multiple Selection** (with `multiple` prop)

   - Click checkboxes to select multiple items
   - Drag one of the selected items
   - All selected items should move together

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Hover over items (should scale slightly)
   - While dragging, item becomes semi-transparent
   - Drop indicator shows where item will be placed

## New Commands

```bash
# Development (with Vite)
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm start          # Alias for dev

# Building
npm run build      # Build library (Rollup)
npm run build:demo # Build demo app (Vite)

# Preview
npm run preview    # Preview production build

# Testing
npm test           # Run tests with Vitest
```

## Breaking Changes

### For Library Users

If someone is using your library (version 1.x), they need to know:

1. **Minimum React version is now 19.0.0**

   ```bash
   npm install react@19 react-dom@19
   ```

2. **No installation issues** - No need for `--legacy-peer-deps` anymore!

3. **StrictMode now works** - Can safely use:

   ```jsx
   root.render(
     <StrictMode>
       <DragDropComponent {...props} />
     </StrictMode>
   );
   ```

4. **API unchanged** - No code changes needed, same props and behavior!

## Documentation Files

2. **Check console** - No errors should appear
3. **Test in different browsers** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### For Publishing

When ready to publish version 2.0.0:

```bash
# Build the library
npm run build

# Publish to npm
npm publish
```

### For Users

Update your README badges and npm package page to highlight:

- ✨ React 19 support
- ✨ Zero external drag-drop dependencies
- ✨ Native HTML5 implementation
- ✨ StrictMode compatible

## Performance Gains

Expected improvements:

| Metric           | Before (1.0) | After (2.0) | Improvement       |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Dev Server Start | ~5s          | <1s         | **5x faster**     |
| HMR Update       | ~500ms       | ~50ms       | **10x faster**    |
| Bundle Size      | +100KB       | 0KB         | **100KB smaller** |
| Initial Load     | Slower       | **Faster**  | Noticeably better |

## Troubleshooting

### If drag-and-drop doesn't work:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure dev server is running
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### If dependencies fail:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### If build fails:

```bash
npm run build -- --verbose
```

## Support

For issues or questions:

- Check the documentation files
